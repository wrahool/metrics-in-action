# Metrics in Action: How Social Media Metrics Shape News Production on Facebook

Replication scripts for the Metrics in Action project by Subhayan Mukerjee, Tian Yang, and Yilang Peng.

To run these scripts
- change the `data_folder` variable to reflect the path to the folder that contains all the `.csv` files
- create a subfolder called `results/` outside the scripts folder
- create a subfolder called `figures/` outside the scripts folder

Your working directory should have three subfolders in it:
- `scripts/` containing all the scripts in the repository
- `results/` which will contain the results (as `.tex` tables) after the scripts are executed
- `figures/` which will contain the plots (as `.svg` images) after the scripts are executed

Details about the scripts are as follows:

- `01_longitudinal-analysis.R` creates figure 1 (in the main text).
- `02_main-analysis.R` creates table 1 and figures 2 and 3 (in the main text).

All other scripts produce the various results and figures in the Appendix. Details of which script produces which table and figure are documented at the beginning of each script.
